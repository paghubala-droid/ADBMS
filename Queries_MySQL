Constraints
Definition
Constraints are rules used to specify the data in a table. When the table is created at that time we can define the constraints.The constraint can be column level 
i.e. we can impose constraint on the column and table level i.e we can impose constraint on the entire table.

There are various types of constraints that can be defined are as follows -
1. Domain Constraints
2. Key Constraints
    i) Primary Key Constraints
    ii) Foreign Key Constraints
3. Default Constraints
4. Check Constraints
5. Unique Constraints
6. NOT NULL Constraints

Domain Constraints
A domain is defined as the set of all unique values permitted for an attribute. 
For example, a domain of date is the set of all possible valid dates and a domain of Integer is all possible whole numbers.
This in effect is defining rules for a particular attribute. 
If it is determined that an attribute is a date then it should be implemented in the database to prevent invalid dates being entered.

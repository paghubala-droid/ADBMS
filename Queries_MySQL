Constraints
Definition
Constraints are rules used to specify the data in a table. When the table is created at that time we can define the constraints.The constraint can be column level 
i.e. we can impose constraint on the column and table level i.e we can impose constraint on the entire table.

There are various types of constraints that can be defined are as follows -
1. Domain Constraints
2. Key Constraints

    ii) Foreign Key Constraints
3. Default Constraints
